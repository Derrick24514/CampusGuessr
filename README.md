# Campus Guesser

Campus Guesser is a Python-based interactive game inspired by GeoGuessr, specifically designed for the Carnegie Mellon University campus. Players are randomly placed in locations across the campus map and are challenged to guess where they are by interacting with the map. It was made in 24 hours as part of Carnegie Mellon's Hack112 Hackathon and won 3rd Place overall!

## Features

- **5 rounds of gameplay**: You are shown a random location on the campus and must guess where you are.
- **Interactive map**: Use an intuitive map interface to navigate and submit your guesses.
- **Leaderboard**: Track your high scores and see how you rank against others.
- **Educational and fun**: Explore and learn about the Carnegie Mellon campus while having fun.

## How to Play

1. Start a new game from the main screen.
2. Navigate through the campus map and use the minimap to place your guess.
3. Submit your guess and see how close you were to the actual location.
4. Repeat for multiple rounds and aim for a high score to make it to the leaderboard!
